# Linear-Quantum-Results
This repository contains the quantum implementations of the linear layers for the paper, **Quantum Implementation of Linear and Non-Linear Layers** by Anubhab Baksi, Sumanta Chakraborty, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Matthew Chun, SK Hafizul Islam, Kyungbae Jang, Hyunji Kim, Yujin Oh, Soham Roy, Hwajeong Seo, Siyi Wang; accepted in IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SoCC), 2024.

## Results
The following results are the currently best-known (those are being updated even after the camera-ready version of the paper is submitted):

**AES MixColumn** -- [97 × 16 (CNOT count × Quantum depth)](./AES/aes_mixcol-97xor-16qdepth-slp.txt)

## Format
All the results are in in-place SWAP and in-place XOR operations.
